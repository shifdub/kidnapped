## Summary


Ever been in a jam where time was crucial to your survival? Perhaps you've been in a car crash where you were pinned down and couldnt reach your phone to call 911, or possibly attacked or even kidnapped where the assailants took your phone? These are scenarios where time could mean life or death. What if there was a way to activate a distress call or text to 911 without unlocking your phone to manually dial or unlocking to asking Alexa to make the call. What if the phone was nearby but out of your hands completely?
The Kidnapped App is intended to save lives. 

## Intended users


* Kidnapped person

	> As someone who has been in emergency situations before, I would like to be able to send out a discrete text to my family so they can call or come to help.
	
* My Friend Rubin

	> As someone who has been in many vehicle wrecks where everything in the car went flying all over, including his cell phone. He would benefit from an app that would allow him to access his phone without unlocking it.
 
* Motorcycle Rider

	> As a motorcycle enthusiast I often have my cell phone in my backpack. I would benefit from an app that could allow me to get help should i ever become injured and can't reach my phone.
  
				
## Functionality


 * With Kidnapped App the user that is unable to touch their phone to send out a call for help, will now be able to send a customized text by speaking, whispering, or shouting a pre-recorded passphrase unknown to an assailant such as "I HAVE A GREEN DOG" or "BEETLE JUICE! BEETLE JUICE! BEETLE JUICE!" to activate a discreet text to family or friends and alert them as soon as possible. 

## Persistent data


 * A secret passphrase input from user  stored in app 
 
 * A recording of the user's voice to activate app to send out text
